/*
Package "ranges" declares a set of classes that maintain a range of primitive
values of a generic type:
  - Interval (a finite discrete range)
  - Spectrum (an infinite discrete range)
  - Continuum (an infinite continuous range)

For detailed documentation on this package refer to the wiki:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-component-framework/wiki

This package follows the Crater Dog Technologies™ Go Coding Conventions located
here:
  - https://github.com/craterdog/go-development-tools/wiki/Coding-Conventions

Additional concrete implementations of the classes declared by this package can
be developed and used seamlessly since the interface declarations only depend on
other interfaces and intrinsic types—and the class implementations only depend
on interfaces, not on each other.
